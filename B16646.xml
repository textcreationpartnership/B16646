            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>JUST now an Express is Arrived here from the Camp before <hi>Lymerick,</hi> which brings the following Account; That <hi>Cell. Luson,</hi> who was sent some Days before with a strong Detatchment of 500 select Horse, and some Troops of Dragoons, into the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Clare;</hi> where, meeting with a considerable Party of <hi>Sarsefield</hi>'s Horse and Dragoons, he attacked them with that vigour and success, that Two entire Regiments were cut off, being most killed on the Spot; with a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Number of <hi>Rapparees;</hi> taking several considerable Persons Prisoners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were the Lord <hi>Merrion,</hi> and a Lady of Quality, with most of the Regiments Horses, Accouterments, and Baggage of considerable Value.</p>
                  <p>A strong Detatchment of <hi>Cavalry,</hi> and some <hi>Infantry</hi> were lately sent from the <hi>Camp,</hi> to a Place where great Numbers of <hi>Rapparees</hi> lurk, and continue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Spoils.</hi> Some of our Batteries are raised so high, that they overlook the <hi>Town:</hi> Most of the Inhabitants in the Place, to shelter themselves from being annoyed with our <hi>Bombs,</hi> (which have done very considerable Dammage) are retired into <hi>King's-Island,</hi> which Place we shall speedily Attack. Some of our Great Guns are re-shipt, in order to raise some Batteries on the other side of the River; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our Regiments are passing the <hi>Shannon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have lately taken Fifteen Commission-Officers, Eleven Serjeants, and 105 private Soldiers Prisoners in Two small Forts near the <hi>Shannon:</hi> We hear there is a Communication between <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and Col. <hi>Lundy,</hi> but we cannot tell the Particulars; but 'tis generally said, That <hi>Sarsfield</hi> makes Proposals for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and the Troops he has with him; the Result of which a little Time will shew. We have had very good Weather in the Camp, considering the Time of Year, and we continue to play from our Batteries into the Town, with very great Success and Execution: So that we doubt not the Reduction of the Town in few Days.</p>
